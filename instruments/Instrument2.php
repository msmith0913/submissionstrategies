<p><a href="/people/OHanlon.php">Catholicus [CÃº Uladh] son of 'Avyrcagh' O'Hanlon</a>, removing his girdle, mantle and cap, on bended knees fell at the feet of the King and raising his hands with the palms joined together and holding them erect between the hands of the King, took these words, which were rendered into English by <a href="/people/Talbot.php">Thomas Talbot</a>, interpreter, well skilled in the Irish language, in the midst of many, lay and cleric, well understanding Irish, viz.:</p>
<p>'I become the liegeman of the lord Richard' &c. (as in Instrument I). <button onclick="oathexpand()">+</button><div id="oath" style="display: none; border-style: solid;"><h4><i>Oath from <a href="../instruments/Instrument1.php">Instrument 1</a></i></h4><p>'I, John MacDonald, become liegeman of the lord Richard, King of England and France and Lord of Ireland, sovereign lord of me and my nation, as also of his heirs, kings of England, from this day forth in life, limb, and earthly honour, so that
  he and they shall have over me power of life and death, and I will be faithful to the same and his heirs for ever in all things and will help to defend him and his heirs against all worldly enemies whatsoever, and will be obedient to the laws,
  commands, and ordinances of the same or any of them according to my power and that of all mine: and I will come to the said lord my King and his heirs, being kings of England, and to his or their parliament and council or otherwise whensoever he
  or they shall send for me or whenever I shall be required, called, or summoned on his or their part or the part of their lieutenants: and I will well and faithfully come to the said Lord King, his heirs and their lieutenants, or to any of them,
  to give counsel, and I will do in all and singular that which a good and faithful liegeman ought to do and is bound to do to his natural liege lord, so help me God and these God's holy Gospels.'</p></div> For observing which allegiance, &c., he took corporal oath. The King thereupon admitted him as his liege and he requested the notary to make him a public instrument.</p>
