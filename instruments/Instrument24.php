<p>Notarial Instrument XXIV records that: on the 29th day of March, 1395, in the church of the Friars Minor at Castledermot, in the presence of King Richard, the notary, and others, Malachy [Maelsechlainn] O’More, removing his girdle, sword, and cap, on bended knees took these words in Irish, which were rendered into English by Guy Lenfaunt, viz.: I, Malachy O’More, become liegeman of my lord King Richard ’, &c. [as in Instrument I],</p>

<div id="oath" style="display: none; border-style: solid;"><h4><i>Oath from <a href="../instruments/Instrument1.php">Instrument 1</a></i></h4>
  <p>'I, John MacDonald, become liegeman of the lord Richard, King of England and France and Lord of Ireland, sovereign lord of me and my nation, as also of his heirs, kings of England, from this day forth in life, limb, and earthly honour, so that
    he and they shall have over me power of life and death, and I will be faithful to the same and his heirs for ever in all things and will help to defend him and his heirs against all worldly enemies whatsoever, and will be obedient to the laws,
    commands, and ordinances of the same or any of them according to my power and that of all mine: and I will come to the said lord my King and his heirs, being kings of England, and to his or their parliament and council or otherwise whensoever he
    or they shall send for me or whenever I shall be required, called, or summoned on his or their part or the part of their lieutenants: and I will well and faithfully come to the said Lord King, his heirs and their lieutenants, or to any of them,
    to give counsel, and I will do in all and singular that which a good and faithful liegeman ought to do and is bound to do to his natural liege lord, so help me God and these God's holy Gospels.'</p>

<p>Whereupon came Touhe [?Tuathal] O’Kelly of Leighlin diocese, Philip O’Kelly, and O’Toole and did liege homage similarly. For the observing of which allegiances and of the conventions contained in a certain indenture made between the King on one side and Art MacMurrough and Gerald O’Byrne on the other, each singly took corporal oath, whereupon the King admitted them as his lieges. Thereupon they requested the notary to make them public instruments.</p>

<p>Witnesses: the bishops of Chichester and Llandaff, the Earl of Huntingdon, Thomas Percy, and William Scrope.</p>
