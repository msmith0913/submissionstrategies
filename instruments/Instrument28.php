    <h1>Notarial Instrument 28</h1>
    <h2>The Submission of Thomas Carragh Kavanagh et al</h2>
    <h3>Submission text (English, translated by Edmund Curtis)</h3>
    <p>Notarial Instrument XXVIII records that: on the 30th day of March, 1395, in a meadow situated between the castle of Carlow and a certain bank of the river, in the presence of King Richard, the notary, [190] and others, Thomas Carragh Kavanagh, of Leighlin diocese, removing his girdle, sword, and cap, on bended knees took these words in Irish, which were rendered into English by Richard Nelgan, interpreter, viz.: ‘I, Thomas Carragh Kavanagh, become liegeman’, &c. [as in Instrument I].</p>

    <div id="oath" style="display: none; border-style: solid;"><h4><i>Oath from <a href="../instruments/Instrument1.php">Instrument 1</a></i></h4>
      <p>'I, John MacDonald, become liegeman of the lord Richard, King of England and France and Lord of Ireland, sovereign lord of me and my nation, as also of his heirs, kings of England, from this day forth in life, limb, and earthly honour, so that
        he and they shall have over me power of life and death, and I will be faithful to the same and his heirs for ever in all things and will help to defend him and his heirs against all worldly enemies whatsoever, and will be obedient to the laws,
        commands, and ordinances of the same or any of them according to my power and that of all mine: and I will come to the said lord my King and his heirs, being kings of England, and to his or their parliament and council or otherwise whensoever he
        or they shall send for me or whenever I shall be required, called, or summoned on his or their part or the part of their lieutenants: and I will well and faithfully come to the said Lord King, his heirs and their lieutenants, or to any of them,
        to give counsel, and I will do in all and singular that which a good and faithful liegeman ought to do and is bound to do to his natural liege lord, so help me God and these God's holy Gospels.'</p>

<p>Then came David More O’Morgh [O’Morchoe or O’Murchadha] and Gillapatrick Rua O'More and did liege homage similarly, except that Gillapatrick on account of corporal infirmity did his liege homage on horseback to the King, who similarly was seated on his horse. Then on the same day at Leighlinbridge came Donal O'Nolan to the door of the church of the Carmelites at Leighlin bridge and did liege homage to the King in the same manner, his words being faithfully rendered from Irish into English by Simon Vale, interpreter.</p>
<p>For observing which, and keeping faithfully all conventions made between the King on one side and Art MacMurrough and Gerald O’Byrne on the other, each singly took corporal oath on the holy Gospels. Whereupon the King admitted them as his lieges and they requested the notary to make them public instruments.</p>
