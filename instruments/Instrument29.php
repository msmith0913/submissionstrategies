    <h2>The Submission of Niall Og and Niall Mor O'Neill</h2>
    <h3>Submission text (English, translated by Edmund Curtis)</h3>
    <p>Notarial Instrument XXIX records that: on the 19th day of January, 1394 [N.S. 1395], in a room within the enclosure of the Friars Preachers in Drogheda, in presence of the notary, &c., Niall O’Neill senior did liege homage to our lord Richard the Second, King of England and France, Duke of Aquitaine, and Lord of Ireland, for himself, his sons, his nation, and his subjects in Irish, publicly rendered into Latin by interpreters, in this form of words, as follows:</p>
<p>‘I, Niall O’Neill senior, both for me and my sons, my whole nation and kin and all my subjects, become your liegeman from this day forth in life and limb and earthly honour to live and die with you against all men, and both I and all the aforesaid, my sons, my whole nation and kin, and all my subjects will be faithful to you and your heirs and will bear true fealty to you and your heirs, so help me God and these God’s holy Gospels.’</p>
<p>And the said O’Neill senior brought a power of proxy to the Lord King Richard in the name of his son for doing liege homage as above, viz.:</p>
<p>‘Let it appear to all by these presents that I, Niall O’Neill junior, captain of my nation, have made and ordained and constituted in my place ’, &c. [as in Instrument XVI].</p>
