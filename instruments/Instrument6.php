  <h1>Notarial Instrument 6</h1>
  <h2>The Submission of Tatheus O'Mare and Turloch O'Conor</h2>
  <h3>Submission text (English, translated by Edmund Curtis)</h3>
  <p>Notarial Instrument VI records that: on the 16th day of April, 1395, in the convent church of the Friars Preachers outside the walls in the suburbs of Kilkenny in the presence of King Richard:</p>
<p>‘Tatheus O’Mare [Taig O’Meagher] of Munster, captain of his nation, removing his girdle, &c., and on bended knees, &c. [as in Instrument I], took these words in Irish, which were rendered in English by [157] John Malachy, chaplain, interpreter, in the presence of many, both cleric and lay, well understanding the Irish language then standing around, viz.: </p>
<p>‘”I, T. O’M., become liegeman of Richard, King of England”, &c. [as in Instrument I].<button onclick="oathexpand()">+</button><div id="oath" style="display: none; border-style: solid;"><h4><i>Oath from <a href="../instruments/Instrument1.php">Instrument 1</a></i></h4><p>'I, John MacDonald, become liegeman of the lord Richard, King of England and France and Lord of Ireland, sovereign lord of me and my nation, as also of his heirs, kings of England, from this day forth in life, limb, and earthly honour, so that
  he and they shall have over me power of life and death, and I will be faithful to the same and his heirs for ever in all things and will help to defend him and his heirs against all worldly enemies whatsoever, and will be obedient to the laws,
  commands, and ordinances of the same or any of them according to my power and that of all mine: and I will come to the said lord my King and his heirs, being kings of England, and to his or their parliament and council or otherwise whensoever he
  or they shall send for me or whenever I shall be required, called, or summoned on his or their part or the part of their lieutenants: and I will well and faithfully come to the said Lord King, his heirs and their lieutenants, or to any of them,
  to give counsel, and I will do in all and singular that which a good and faithful liegeman ought to do and is bound to do to his natural liege lord, so help me God and these God's holy Gospels.'</p></div></p>

<p>‘This done, came Terrelagh O’Concor de Connacia [Turloch O’Conor of Connacht] and did liege homage to the Lord King delivered under the same form. And for the observing and affirming these allegiances and fealties towards the Lord our King as their sovereign lord, and his heirs being kings of England, having touched and kissed the holy Gospels, they took corporal oaths, and further by a similar oath, the said T. O’Concor bound himself that if, which God forbid, he shall violate his said oath in part or in whole, doing or procuring to be done anything by himself or others in contempt of the said Lord King or his heirs or to the offence of himself or his heirs or to the detriment of his government or that of his heirs, he will pay to the Papal Camera 20,000 marks of good and lawful sterling English money.’</p>
<p>The King thereupon admitted Taig O’Meagher and Turloch O’Conor as his lieges and they requested the notary to make them public instruments.</p>
<p>Witnesses: Tideman and Robert, bishops of Llandaff and Lismore-Waterford, John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, and William Scrope, the King’s Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Affirmation of Thomas Sparkeford, clerk of the diocese of Bath and Wells, public notary, that hew as present with the other witnesses and has drawn [158] up an instrument in public form accordingly and appended his seal.</p>
